description: There is a lot of overlap between agile and lean but we know the differences. People often think about agile in software development and lean in manufucturing and services. The truth is that both have some great ideas that can be applied to any sector. Sometimes lean is focused on process improvement, which can be great but we would also want to talk about the mindsets and culture.
