description: We are experienced agile coaches and delivery managers with experience across a wide range of methods. We have worked with SAFe, LeSS and DAD and have Certified Scrum Professionals within our ranks. We can work on short engagements where we review your current state covering mindsets/culture, organisation, processes and even tools. We are happy to do that with no strings attached but particularly enjoy where we can engage over the longer-term to have a much larger and sustainable influence, which can work well on a part-time basis. If you are new to agile, we are very happy to meet you for a coffee to share our thoughts and help you get started, no fees required!
