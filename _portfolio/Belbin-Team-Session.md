description: We are firm believers in the power of Belbin Team Roles. There are other techniques (PRISM, MBTI etc.) that can also be useful but we really like the balance with Belbin of sound research and theory but remaining relatively easy to use. We can use Belbin for individual engagements supporting coaching and recruitment but to unleash it's full potential, we can run really fun 2-4 hours sessions with teams, which work as great team builders with some really useful content.
